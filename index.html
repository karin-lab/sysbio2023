  <h1>Systems Biology (TCC Course)</h1>
    <h2>Course Syllabus</h2>
    <p>
      In this course, we will provide an overview of the systems biology approach to modeling biological systems. Our goal would be to understand how interactions between biological components such as genes, proteins, and cells, give rise to the functional properties of biological systems. We will cover topics ranging from simple genetic circuits (providing mechanisms for bistability, ultrasensitivity, and oscillations) to higher-level emergent properties that arise from the interactions of many molecules and cells. The course does not assume any background in biology and will be largely self-contained.

		<section id="week1">
			<h2>Week 1: Background on cell biology and systems biology</h2>
			<p>In this week, we will provide a brief overview of molecular cell biology and introduce the systems biology approach to modeling biological systems.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="week2">
			<h2>Week 2: Modularity and network motifs</h2>
			<p>We will explore the issue of modularity in biological regulation. We will also introduce the concept of network motifs and how they are used to understand compelx biological networks. We will analyze the simple motif of negative autoregulation.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="week3">
			<h2>Week 3: Feedforward regulation; bistability</h2>
			<p>We will discuss in detail feedforward regulation, and consider bistability and its role in long-term biological memory.</p>
		</section>
    
    <section id="week4">
			<h2>Week 4: Robustness in bacterial chemotaxis; fold-change detection</h2>
			<p>We introduce the fundamental concepts of robustness and integral feedback by exploring classic work on bacterial navigation.</p>
		</section>

    <section id="week5">
			<h2>Week 5: Robustness in the glucose-insulin system; dynamical compensation</h2>
			<p>Here we will explore how the concept of robustness can be used to understand human physiology and disease susceptibility, specifically focusing on the glucose-insulin system.</p>
